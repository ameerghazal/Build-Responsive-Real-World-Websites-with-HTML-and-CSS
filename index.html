    <h2>The Basic Language of the Web: HTML</h2>

    <p>Posted by <strong>Laura Jones</strong> on Monday, June 21st 2027</p>

    <p>
      All modern websites and web applications are built using three
      <em>fundamental</em>
      technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These are the languages of the
      web.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all about,
      and why you too should learn it.

    <h3>What is HTML?</h3>

    <p>
      HTML stands for <strong>H</strong>yper<b>Text</b> <strong>M</strong>arkup
      <strong>L</strong>anguage. It's a markup language that web developers use
      to structure and describe the content of a webpage (not a programming
      language).
    </p>

    <!-- <b> is the old bold and <i> is the old italic, but I used to show the old way as well. -->
    <p>
      HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content:
      paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc. Web browsers understand
      HTML and render HTML code as websites.
