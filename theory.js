    SECTION 2: HTML Fundamentals

    Introduction to HTML
    - HTML: Hyper Text Markup Langauge
    - Used to describe something.
    - Consists of elements that describe things: paragrpahs, links, headings, etc.
    - HTML element is made of three things:
      - Opening tag: name of the element wrapped in <> (<p>)
      - Content: content of the element. It can contain an element in a element (for example, a div)
      - Closing tag: same as the opening tag but with a / (</p>)
      - For elements, such as an img element, they do not contain content, and we can omit the closing tag.
