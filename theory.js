    SECTION 1: Introduction 

    First Webpage 
    - Exclamation mark with a tab creates a skeleton website structure.
    - h1 stands for heading 1, h2 smaller, ..., hn.
    - p stands for paragraph.
    - Do the edits in the body element.
    - Use the greater than less than symbols: <p>Data and close it with the right.</p>

    SECTION 2: HTML Fundamentals

    Introduction to HTML
    - HTML: Hyper Text Markup Langauge
    - Used to describe something.
    - Consists of elements that describe things: paragrpahs, links, headings, etc.
    - HTML element is made of three things:
      - Opening tag: name of the element wrapped in <> (<p>)
      - Content: content of the element. It can contain an element in a element (for example, a div)
      - Closing tag: same as the opening tag but with a / (</p>)
      - For elements, such as an img element, they do not contain content, and we can omit the closing tag.

  
      HTML Document Structure
      - <!DOCTYPE html> tells the browser that the doc uses html. This is the first thing we must declare.
      - This is followed by <html></html> an html element
      - From there, imbedded into the html tag is a head element and a body element.
      - <head></head> contains things that are not visible in the browser. For example, link to style sheets, page title, etc.
      - <body></body> contains things that are always visible on the page. For example, paragraph, h1, etc.
      - indentation is important for properly reading html.
      - We alawys need to start with the doctype, followed by the html element, which includes the head and body tags.

      Text Elements
      - We can go all the way from h1 to h6. They all stand for heading. Lots of times, only one h1 is used.
      - All headings use the same element structure <hn></hn> where n ranges from 1 to 6. We can use multiple heading of the same size, but h1 should only be used once.
      - Comments use a <! -- ... --> structure, but simply ctrl slash does the job as well.
      - Paragraph element is the <p> element, which typically uses words.
      - Wrapping words in a <b></b> element bolds words. However, b is an old html elemnt. Instead, use the strong element, which makes it an important element to stand out: <strong> ... </strong>
      - <strong></strong> element bolds words. 
      - Wrapping words in a <i></i> element italizes words. However, this is outdated. Now, we should use the em element, which empasizes text.
      - <em> ... </em> element italizes words.

      More Text Elements: Lists
      - list of bullet points, ordered lists, etc.
      - Numbered List: <ol> </ol> this stands for an ordered list. Inside the ol, we need to create an <li> element, which stands for list item.
      - <li> </li> element refers to a list item.
      - <ol> </ol> creates a numbered list.
      - A container of another element is the parent, and the elements inside of the list, for example, are the child elements. 
      - Bullet list: for this type of list, we use the <ul> </ul> element, which stands for an unorded list. We still need indiviual <li> element for each list item.
      - <ul> </ul> creates an unordred list.
      - Lists are very important in html.
      - Needs to follow a structure.

      Images and Attributes
      - <img> element is a special element. It does not hold and content, so we do not need a closing tag.
      - We use an attribute for images. In this case we use the source attribute, which stands for "src"
      - Instead, use <img src="..." />
      - Note, if something is imbedded into a folder, vs needs to access that folder. For example, the image was in the starter folder, so the img element tag would be:
      - Besides the src, there are other attributes. One important one for images is the alt attribute.
      - alt="" let's the source image have a description.
      - <img src="starter/post-img.jpg" alt="HTML code on a screen." />
      - We can also specify the width and height attributes: w
      - width="" & height =""
      -ex: <img src="starter/post-img.jpg" alt="HTML code on a screen."
        width="500" height="200"/>
      - in the <html tag, specify the language. In this case, <html lang="en"> would be correct. Other languages have other codes. 
      - In the head tag, specify the character set attribute with:
          <meta charset="UTF-8" />, since it describes the page.

      
      Hyperlinks
      - Every single website on the internet has its own url.
      - Hyperlinks are used with anchor element; in short, <a></a>
      - Inside the opening tag, we use the href attribute to set the url.
      - Inside the content space, we display what would be shown on the screen.
      - Closing tags are needed.
      - Also, we can nest elements inside on another. For example, we can open a paragraph element, start it, add in an anchor, then continue and finish the paragraph.
      ex: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML">
          MDN Web Docs</a>
      - To open in a new tab rather than move away, add the target="_blank" attribute after the href.
      - We can also link another html file. In doing so, we simply specify that html file in our href (e.g. href="index.html"). 
      - Doing this is cool because we can specify the way back as well.
      - href property is the real deal to making it a link.
      - If we do not want the link to point anywhere, use the "#" inside of the href element.
      ex: <a href="#">Challenges</a>


      Structuring out Page
      - Container elements group elements together.
      - <nav></nav> elements groups elements together makes it much more helpful. 
      - <header></header> is the top part of the web document, or a smaller unit. This is also good for telling the browser and grouping elements.
      - <article></article> is good for grouping atricle information.
      - So now, our body only has two direct elements: a header and an article.
      - <footer></footer> is the content that comes at the very end of a page. For example, a copyright tag.
      - HTML entites can create minor logos, etc.
      - Use the & symbol followed by the tag name. For example, &copy; creates a copyright symbol.


      A note on Semantic HTML
      - Certain elements have a meaning or a purpose attached to them. Instead of thinking how it looks on the page, we should think of the meaning of it.
      - For example, using the bold element vs. the strong element. One has meaning, while one does not.
      - div stands for a box without any meaning. However, we should use a nav instead when wanting to use an acutal navigation.
      - <div></div> can really be used for anything. Navigation, paragraphs, etc. They take more space, though. 
      - The main idea, though, is to use sematic html to give our elements meanin.
      - This is better for search engine optimatzation. Also, it is better for accessibility. 
      - <aside></aside> element that contains extra seperate info.
      - <article></article> element can be used for any type of article.
      - check the resources page of html entity reference.
      - <button></button> creates a button.

      SECTION 3 CSS FUNDAMENTALS

      Introduction into CSS
      - CSS: Cascading Style Sheets
      - Visual style presentation of the content written in css.
      - Consists of countless properties that developers use to format the content.
      - Starts with a selector, followed by declerations (property: value), which all of the make up the decleration block. 
      - This is all called a CSS Rule.
      ex: h1 (selector) {font-size:24px (prop, value, decleration)} (block)


      Inline, Internal, and External CSS
      - Inline CSS: writing the CSS inside the element. 
      ex: <h1 style="color: blue">ðŸ“˜ The Code Magazine</h1>
        - However, inline styles should usually never be used.
      - Internal CSS: We go to the <head></head> element and open a <style></style> element. From there, we declare and define what we want to style with normal css. 
        - However, if we have a lot of CSS code, internal CSS is not practical.
      - External CSS: putting all the CSS code into its own file.
        - HTML files and CSS files do not automatically link, we need to link them. 
        - We can link a stylesheet with the <link> element in the <head></head> 
        - Use the href attribute to link the stylesheet and define the rel attriubute to tell the browser that it is a stylesheet.
        ex: <link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" />
        - <link ... /> is an element for atttaching css styles mainly.


        Styling Text
        - font-size: ... can be specified with pixels, rem, uv, etc.
        - font-family: specifes different fonts for text.
        - text-transform: ... we control the font (e.g. lowercase, uppercase, etc.)
        - font-style: ... the style of the font (e.g. italic, bold, etc.)
        - Just because the h1 is the main heading of the page, does not mean it needs to be the biggest one.
        - By selecting, for example, the p element. We select all the p elements on the page. If there are 14 p elements, we apply the CSS to all 14 (assuming no classes or id's are invloved)
        - line-height: (number). All it is is the number times the font-size. This changes the spacing between the lines.
        ex:   line-height: 1.5; (it auto sets to 1)
        - Inheritance is when the parent has a style and the child does not override it.
        - text-align: ... (properties) aligns the text in the parent container (e.g. center, will center it)
        - We do not style the <ol></ol> elements or the <ul></ul> elements. We only style the li elements
        -* Default font-size is 16px which is 1rem.

        Combining Selectors
        - We can select multiple selectors to apply the same CSS style by using a comma. 
        ex: h1, h2, h3 {
          font-family: sans-serif;
          color: blue;
        }
        - Wrapping stuff into other elements then applying the style will find the parent and be override by the child if applicable.
        - List selector: combines mutliple selectors(h1, p, etc.)
        - For example, if we have a footer element, and inside the footer element we have other elements, such as a paragraph, anchor, etc. With proper CSS, we can acess the footer and then style its paragraph
        - footer p {
          ....
        }
        - This selector will select all paragraphs that are children of the footers.
        - Descendent selector is what it is called. 
        - We can use a nested descendent selector by, for example, article header p {}


        Class and ID Selectors
        - The problem with descendent selectors is they mess with the HTMl structure. This is where id's come into play.
        - When specifing with an id attribute, we name it something, and use the hash selector in CSS.
        - e.g (<p id="author">) (#author {})
        - with ID's in CSS, we use #idName (so, for the example, above, #author {})
        - CSS uses comments as-well with the same format as JS.
       ex: 
       #author {
          font-style: italic;
          font-size: 18px;
        }
        - Another way of labeling elements is through class attributes. 
        - ID's are not repeatable; therefore, if the id "author" is given to an element, it cannot be reused for a seperate element.
        - If we need to reuse a name multiple times, we need to use classes.
        - CSS convention: for multiple words in classes or id's, use dashs or underscores. 
        - ex: <p class="related-author">
        - For classes, we use the dot notation in css (.related-author)
        - We can reuse classes towards mutliple elements.
        - font-weight: ..., can make text bold.
        - list-style: none; removes styles from css lists (for example, bullet points from a ul element.)
        - all we do for id's and classes is use the attribute followed by a name. From there, we go to CSS using the dot or hash notation and apply styles.
        - ID's are only used once, classes can be used multiple times; however, classes are simply better to use for future notices.
        - we can use more than one class at the same time for one element; seperate them with an actual space. 
        ex: <p class="opium city"></p> in CSS we can apply styles to .opium and .city.


        Working with Colors
        - The RBG model: every color consists of Red, Green, and Blue.
        - In order to represent a certain color, we need to give each of the base colors a value between 0 and 255 (0 red, 0 green, 0 blue)
        - For max red, (255 red, 0 green, 0 blue) and the same goes for blue & green.
        - In white, all the colors are at the max of 255, and for black, all the colors are at 0.
        - From there, there are many combinations that can be put together.
        - Defining colors in CSS: RGB / RGBA notation, Hexadecimal notation.
          - RGB: rgb(0, 0, 0) and from here, we can edit the red, green, blue for a color.
          - RBGA: rgb with transparncy ("alpha") rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3) 
          - important to know what these numbers mean.
          - Hexadecimal notation: instead of using a scale from 0-255, we go from 0 to ff (255 in hexadecimal numbers).
          - Notation: #00ffff (hash, value for red green and blue)
          - Shorthand notation: when all colors are identical pairs (#0ff).
        - In practice, we use the hexadecimal, and if we need transparacy, we use the rgba. 
        - When all colors in all 3 channels are the same, we get a grey color.
        - The higher the three numbers get and closer to 255, the grey is lighter and vice versa.
        ex: color: rgba(50, 192, 38, 0.801); using the color property in css.
        - In CSS, we two of the same definitons (e.g. color property is chosen twice for the same class), the later one is used.
        - background-color: ..., changes the color of the selected background.
        - element selector: selects all with the same element
        - border: ..., accepts multiple properties
          - border creates a box around the box. 
          - We could indiuvally style the  border width, border-style, and border-color properties. Otherwise, with border we can do it all at once.
          ex: border: 5px solid #1098ad;
        - Do not forget about pre-designed color names. 



        Pseudo-classes
        - font-weight: bold ... makes text bold.
        - colon notation: we go to element and use the colon notation to use specific properties. 
        - For example, the first-child selector will look through the element and target the specific first-child element.
        - There are multiple selectors within the pseudo code classes.
        - n-thchild(number) find the specific one. Or we can use key-words, such as odd, even, etc.
        ex: li:nth-child(even) {
               color: red;
            }
        - descendent does not work properly in this case. So, article p:first-child, for example, does not work unless a paragraph is the first-child of the ARTICLE.
        - mixing multiple elements inside of a parent element make pseduo classes not feasible. 


        Styling Hyperlinks
        - Simply selecting the anchor is not a good practice. It is better specify by pseudo.
        - a:link {} targets an anchor element with an href. 
        - text-decoration: none; removes the underline style under links (we can edit this to however we want.)
        - a:visted {} deals with when links have been seen.
        - a:hover {} deals with when a mouse hovers over a link.
        - text-decoration, similar to border, can define the text-decoration-line, text-decoration-style, and text-decoration-color in one go. For example, text-decoration: underline dotted orangered;
        - a:active {} is a pseudo class that occurs when the link is actually cliked. 
        - These four states must be defined in this exact order (LVHA): link, visited, hover, active.

        DevTools
        - some elements have default styles, such as h1.
        - we can also edit inside the browser.
        - On the styles tab, by clicking the :hov, we can an element being hovered, visited, etc.
        - This is great for testing the webpage without messing with the acutal code. 
        - Anything saved in the browser does not save in the actual code. 



        CSS Theory #1: Conflicting between Selectors
        - If there are multiple selectors, which one applies?
        - First up, decleration marked with !important, but they should only be used with need.
        - Next up, inline styles have the 2nd highest; however, they should not be used regardless.
        - Third priority is the ID selector, but if there are multiple, it is the last selector in the code. 
        - Fourth up, is a class (.) or a pseudo-class selector (:) and if there are multiple, it is the last one of them.
        - Fifth, is the element selector (p, div, li, etc.) and if multiple, it is the last one in the code. 
        - Lastly, the universal selector selects everything, but it holds the least weight. 
        - So for a conflciting property, look above to see which one applies. If we have multiple with the same style, look above. 
        - A class can have the same name as an id.
        *- we can add multiple classes to an element by a simple space, etc.
        e.g. <p class="copyright test"></p>
        - hovering over it in VS code will tell us the selector specificity. 
        - !important is a hack for overriding everything else. 


        CSS Theory #2: Inheritance and the Universal Selector
        - Inheritance is a mechanism by which some styles get their properties from parent elements and child elements. 
        - An inherited property have the lowest priorty and can easily be overriden. 
        - For example, if we declare a color in the body (such as red), and from there, we overriden it in a element tag, it gets overriden.
        - This is not conflicting selector, these declare values and get passed down to all the child elements contianed in the body. If they get overridden, so be it.
        - Not everything gets inherited; for example, adding a border to the body. 
        - Most text things get inherited, but not all properties. 
        - Big lists are online. 
        - We can select more than one class or selector in CSS with a comma seperator: .c1, .c2 {} to apply the style to both elements contains the classes. 
        - Universal Selector: * {} applies to all the elements on the page. No ineritance involved.


        CSS Theory #3: The CSS Box Model
        - The Box Model defines how things look on the page. Everything is in style of a box.
        - Content box: text, images, etc. (we can define the width and height)
        - Border box: a line around the element, still inside of the element
        - Padding: invisible space around the content, inside of the element.
        - Margin: space outside of the element, between elements on the page.
        - Padding is empty space inside of any element (between the content and the border), while margin is space in between elements.
        - All of these are actually optional. 
        - Fill Area: srea that gets filled with background color or background image. If we apply a background image or color, it applies to the entire visible part of the image. 
        - Analogy: imagine a frame on the wall. Image is the content area, space between the content and the border is the padding, the frame is the border, and the space between other elements on the wall would be the margin. 
        - Height and width can be specified of the content area; however, they are not the final sizes of the element.
        - Final element width = left border + left padding + width + right padding + right border.
        - Final element height = top border + top padding + height + bottom padding + bottom border.
        - This is a default behavior, but we can change it if we want to.


        Margins and Padding
        - Spacing between the content and the border (outside of the element)
        - It is specififed as padding: ..px (we can do left, right, top, bottom, etc.)
        - We can use similar function but using padding: value (for top, bottom) value2 (left right)
        ex: padding: 20px 40px;
        - Margins: spacing between elements (mar)
        - Typically, the last list item should not contain a space. 
        - margin-bottom: 0; removes the margins from the bottom.
        - Similar to the padding, we can use margin (right, left, top, bottom, etc.)
        - margin does not get inherited from parent to child elements.
        - Use the universial selector for this. 
        - Global reset: * {margin: 0; padding: 0;}
        - Creating vertical space is common. Margin-bottom is nice. 
        - Margins add space from outside the element, while padding adds space within the element.
        - Collapsing margins: if two margins are specified, the larger one is usually displayed on the page. (e.g. if we have 100px from p and 50px from h3, only 100px from p is applied, since it works for both)
        - Vertical space: stick to margin bottom.


        Adding Dimensions
        - Using height and width, we can add dimensions to elements.
        - Width: horizontal
        - Height: vertical
        - According to the box model, the height and width are not fully real. Need to addition in the padding.
        - Better to specify width and height and CSS
        - Setting the height or weight to auto is only nessicary if the dimensions are set in HTML.
        - If we just set one in CSS, with none in HTML, the other property will automatically adapt.
        - Percentages are great for adapting images. 100% is the entire width of the page, etc.

        Centering our Page
        - <div></div> is a simple box.
        - div's are basically containers or frames.
        - So if a div wraps many things, the child elements cannot be larger than the parent container.
        - For example for the images. If the width is 100%, but the container's max width is 700px, the 100% is based off the 700px
        *- margin-left: auto, margin-right: auto, means that both the right and the left need to be centered as they will be the exact same size calculated by the browser.
        - This could also be written as margin: 0 auto;
        - cannot add margins to small elements, such as anchors.
