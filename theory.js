    SECTION 1: Introduction 

    First Webpage 
    - Exclamation mark with a tab creates a skeleton website structure.
    - h1 stands for heading 1, h2 smaller, ..., hn.
    - p stands for paragraph.
    - Do the edits in the body element.
    - Use the greater than less than symbols: <p>Data and close it with the right.</p>
    


    SECTION 2: HTML Fundamentals

    Introduction to HTML
    - HTML: Hyper Text Markup Langauge
    - Used to describe something.
    - Consists of elements that describe things: paragrpahs, links, headings, etc.
    - HTML element is made of three things:
      - Opening tag: name of the element wrapped in <> (<p>)
      - Content: content of the element. It can contain an element in a element (for example, a div)
      - Closing tag: same as the opening tag but with a / (</p>)
      - For elements, such as an img element, they do not contain content, and we can omit the closing tag.

  
      HTML Document Structure
      - <!DOCTYPE html> tells the browser that the doc uses html. This is the first thing we must declare.
      - This is followed by <html></html> an html element
      - From there, imbedded into the html tag is a head element and a body element.
      - <head></head> contains things that are not visible in the browser. For example, link to style sheets, page title, etc.
      - <body></body> contains things that are always visible on the page. For example, paragraph, h1, etc.
      - indentation is important for properly reading html.
      - We alawys need to start with the doctype, followed by the html element, which includes the head and body tags.

      Text Elements
      - We can go all the way from h1 to h6. They all stand for heading. Lots of times, only one h1 is used.
      - All headings use the same element structure <hn></hn> where n ranges from 1 to 6. We can use multiple heading of the same size, but h1 should only be used once.
      - Comments use a <! -- ... --> structure, but simply ctrl slash does the job as well.
      - Paragraph element is the <p> element, which typically uses words.
      - Wrapping words in a <b></b> element bolds words. However, b is an old html elemnt. Instead, use the strong element, which makes it an important element to stand out: <strong> ... </strong>
      - <strong></strong> element bolds words. 
      - Wrapping words in a <i></i> element italizes words. However, this is outdated. Now, we should use the em element, which empasizes text.
      - <em> ... </em> element italizes words.
